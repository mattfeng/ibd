# The Human Microbiome Project (HMP)

## A quick introduction to the HMP
The HMP was split into two phases: **HMP-1**, and **iHMP (Integrative Human Microbiome Project)**.

> HMP-1 characterized the microbial communities found at several different sites on the human body: nasal passages, oral cavity, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and urogenital tract, and examined the role of these microbes in human health and disease.

The iHMP has _three study cohorts_, each examining a different microbiome-associated condition: (1) pregnancy and preterm birth, (2) onset of inflammatory bowel disease, and (3) onset of type 2 diabetes. The studies are named MOMS-PI, IBDMDB, and iPOP, respectively.

Data collection from the three cohorts has concluded.
- MOMS-PI finished collecting data in 2019.
- IBD finished collecting data in 2020.
- iPOP finished collecting data in 2016.

## The data
The size of all the data collected from both phases of the HMP is **48.54 TB**. Luckily, for many of our analyses, we will only require a fraction of that.

### Analyzing HMP-1 Data
The total size of HMP-1 data is about **38 TB**.
