# The Human Microbiome Project (HMP)

##
The HMP was split into two phases: **HMP-1**, and **iHMP (Integrative Human Microbiome Project)**.

The iHMP has _three study cohorts_, each examining a different microbiome-associated condition: (1) pregnancy and preterm birth, (2) onset of inflammatory bowel disease, and (3) onset of type 2 diabetes.
