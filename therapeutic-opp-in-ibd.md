- Microbiome is affected by
  - location in GI tract
  - human genetics (e.g. NOD2 variants)
- Looking at how human genetics affects proteins that interact with microbes 
  - NOD2, CARD9
  - Unraveling host-microbe interactions will require
    - larger cohorts
    - stool sample biobanking
    - microbiome typing of bacteria, fungi, small eukaryotes, and vira
