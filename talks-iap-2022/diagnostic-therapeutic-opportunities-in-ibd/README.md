# Diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities in inflammatory bowel disease

## Opportunity 1: What is IBD?
- Redefining the cellular and spatio-cellular features of IBD

## Opportunity 2: Causes and triggers of IBD?
- Can we create tools that identify the triggers of pathologic/regulatory
  T cells in disease?
- What are the implications for disease risk, recurrence and therapy
- We do serial profiling of microbes and their metabolic potential
  - Limitations
    - Technology
    - Scale
    - Cost
    - Develop and rank most predictive assays into a format that would be
      helpful in the context of small tissue biopsies in routine evaluation of
      patients with IBD.

## Opportunity 3: Therapies for IBD?
- Personalized medicine has not been at the forefront of IBD therapy
- Emerging marketplace of therapeutics including various biologics
- Public data with paired molecular and patient survey info exist
- Real world data exists, however limited pairing with molecular data
