# IBD Tracker
- Eric Alm, CMIT and the IBD Tracker Trial
- Marjolein Klaassen, IBD Tracker: identifying biomarkers in the gut microbiome
  predictive of an IBD flare

- Current focus on those already with IBD
  - How do we prevent flare-ups?

## Notes
- Identifying the bacteria present in the microbiome
  - No single bacteria as obvious factor
- Medical records will integrate new data and analyses

### The science
- M-cells absorb and expose pathogens to internal immune system
  - Peyer's patches are the training centers of immune cells

### Structure of the IBD tracker trial
- Patients
  - Adults with IBD
  - **University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG)**, 50 patients
  - **Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)**, 50 patients
- Study length
  - 12 month period
- Samples
  - Blood
    - T-cell receptor sequences
    - cytokine profile
    - metabolite profile
  - Urine
    - metabolite profile
  - Feces (weekly)
    - metagenomics
    - metatranscriptomics
    - metabolomics
    - culturing and isolation of microbes
    - calprotectin levels
  - Physiologic parameters and disease monitoring
    - weekly clinical questionnaires
    - fitbit
- Monitoring
  - If a patient is suspected to have a future flare, conduct extra sampling of
    blood, urine, and feces
    - predictors of future flare
      - increasing scores on clinical questionnaires
      - increasing measurements of fecal calprotectin

## Problems to tackle

### Research
- Predicting disease course
- Figuring out the causes of patients going from inactive to active disease

### Business
- Lowering the cost of the IBD Tracker
  - Focus in on the factors that are most predictive
- Make mailing samples easy
- Sample collection kit that is not onerous
  - Make it feel like patients are at the cutting edge, rather in a research
    study
- Finding people for Phase II of the IBD Tracker
- Finding funds to increase access to the IBD Tracker

## Questions for Eric Alm
- How should we go about getting access to the IBD tracker data (respecting
  data confidentiality prepublication, etc.)?
- Are we able to talk to any of the people in the IBD tracker study to validate
  assumptions (e.g. how onerous is sample collection)?
- Where are samples currently sent for analysis? How are they sent? How often?
- Suppose we identify two or three main predictive factors, so we don't need to
  collect many different kinds of samples from each patient (the most expensive
  part of Phase I). What would be the main bottleneck in scaling up the trial
  for Phase II?
