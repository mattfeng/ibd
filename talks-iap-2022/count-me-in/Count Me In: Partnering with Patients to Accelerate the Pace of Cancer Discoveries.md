# Count Me In: Partnering with Patients to Accelerate the Pace of Cancer Discoveries

## Challenges of studying patient tumor samples
- 85% of U.S. cancer patients are treated in community settings
- most patients' samples and data have not been readily available for study

## Idea
- What if we could generate a massive publicly available database of clinical,
  genomic, molecular, and patient reported data in cancer?

## Iteration 1: The Metastatic Breast Cancer Project
