## Assays

### Metagenomics

### Fecal calprotectin


## Questions
- Do protocols transfer? The current analysis protocol is through the Broad, with its set of DNA/RNA extraction kits using fresh stool. If the stool was instead captured in a DNA/RNA preservative, and another analysis done to address bias introduced by the preservative, would the results of the new protocol still be (clinically) relevant?
- What is the current cost estimate for mWGS sequencing, mRNAseq, and fecal calprotectin?
- What frequency do stool samples actually need to be taken?
