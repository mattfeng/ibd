- Microbiome is affected by
  - location in GI tract
  - human genetics (e.g. NOD2 variants)
- Looking at how human genetics affects proteins that interact with microbes 
  - NOD2, CARD9
  - Unraveling host-microbe interactions will require
    - larger cohorts
    - stool sample biobanking
    - microbiome typing of bacteria, fungi, small eukaryotes, and vira

## Terms
- M cell.
  - microfold cell
  - epithelial cells embedded in the epithelium of mucosal tissues
  - have high capacity for transcytosis of a wide range of microorganisms and macromolecules
- Mucosal tissue (mucosal membrane, mucosa)
  - tissue membrane lining all body passages that communicate with the air
    - e.g. respiratory and alimentary tracts
  - has cells and associated glands that secrete mucus
