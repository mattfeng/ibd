## Problems to tackle

### Research
- Predicting disease course
- Figuring out the causes of patients going from inactive to active disease
- Better data for better characterization of IBD

### Business
- Lowering the cost of the IBD Tracker
  - Focus in on the factors that are most predictive
- Make mailing samples easy
- Sample collection kit that is not onerous
  - Make it feel like patients are at the cutting edge, rather in a research
    study
- Finding people for Phase II of the IBD Tracker
- Finding funds to increase access to the IBD Tracker

## Things to look into
- What are the regulatory requirements for a diagnostic?
