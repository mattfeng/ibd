## Problems to tackle

### Research
- Predicting disease course
- Figuring out the causes of patients going from inactive to active disease
  - tools to identify triggers of pathologic/regulatory T cells in disease
  - how do we get this data back to the patient in a way that is meaningful
    - T-cell _X_ is responding to organism _Y_
  - Potential
    - potential for individualization: personalization of response in terms of
      microbes, immune response, and cellular heterogeneity as a function of
      time
  - Challenges
    - technology, scale, and cost
    - how to develop and rank the most predictive assays on small tissue
      biopsies
- Better therapies for IBD
- Better characterization of IBD
  - Need to collect better data
  - Redefine cellular and spatio-cellular features of IBD

### Business
- Lowering the cost of the IBD Tracker
  - Focus in on the factors that are most predictive
- Make mailing samples easy
- Sample collection kit that is not onerous
  - Make it feel like patients are at the cutting edge, rather in a research
    study
- Finding people for Phase II of the IBD Tracker
- Finding funds to increase access to the IBD Tracker
- Data challenges
  - Gaps in data due to missed study visits
  - Planning data collection with retrospective studies in mind
  - Data quality varies as methods improve
- Subject follow up can be challenging
- Keeping track of all interactions between study coordinators and possible
  subjects (i.e. keep track of those who do not want to partake)

<details>
<summary><b>Finding people for Phase II of the IBD tracker</b></summary>

- Recruiting
  - Screen against past illnesses
  - Screen for IBD
  - Set up criteria for controls
- Logistics
  - approaching subjects
  - setting study visits
  - recuitment of special cohorts
  - acquiring consent

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Sample collection</b></summary>

- Unique ID for each asmple
- Samples must be processed according to protocol and collaborator requests
  - For IBD tracker, **Freezerworks** is used to barcode and track sample
    attributes and location

## Things to look into
- What are the regulatory requirements for a diagnostic?
