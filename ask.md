# Questions to ask

## Sathish Subramarian
- Are there clinically relevant biomarkers that have already been identified
  (biomarkers that have moved beyond the research phase)?
- How many patients have enough samples (microbiome, biopsy, metabolites, etc.)
  such that their IBD can be subtyped for precision medicine?
  - If not, what are the barriers to them collecting such samples and having
    them analyzed?
- What is the pathway towards precision medicine?
  - Is it still in the research phase? If so, what data would we need to
    collect to enable precision medicine?
